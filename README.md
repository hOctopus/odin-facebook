This is the Building Facebook project of the Ruby on Rails course at
The Odin Project.
http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/final-project?ref=lc-pb

It closely follows the Twitter-style microposting Sample App developed in
Chapters 3 through 12 of Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial, available
at http://www.railstutorial.org/.

Major differences from Hartl's Rails Tutorial include:
-- Devise authentication (https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
-- Omniauth authorization (https://github.com/intridea/omniauth)
-- Likes and comments
